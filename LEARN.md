# Learning Guide for DB-FX

Welcome to the DB-FX learning guide! This document is designed to help students and learners understand and interact with the DB-FX project, a JavaFX-based database management application. Through this guide, you will learn about JavaFX, database management, multithreading, and more.

## Overview

DB-FX is an application built using JavaFX that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database. It showcases advanced JavaFX features, threading in Java, and interaction with a database using JDBC.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher
- Basic understanding of Java and SQL

## Getting Started with DB-FX

1. **Clone the Project**: Get a local copy of the DB-FX project by cloning its repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mikimaine/db-fx.git
   ```
2. **Explore the Code**: Navigate through the project files to understand the structure and components of a JavaFX application.

## Key Learning Areas

### JavaFX Basics
- Understand how JavaFX is used to build the UI of the application.
- Learn about Scene Builder and FXML for designing user interfaces.

### Advanced JavaFX
- Study how event handling is managed in JavaFX.
- Explore the use of custom components and controls.

### Database Management
- Learn how the application connects to and interacts with a database.
- Understand how CRUD operations are implemented in Java applications.

### Multithreading in JavaFX
- Discover how DB-FX uses Java's multithreading features to perform database operations without freezing the UI.
- Analyze how asynchronous tasks are managed and executed in JavaFX.

### Maven Build System
- Understand how Maven is used to build and manage the DB-FX project.
- Learn about Maven dependencies, build lifecycle, and plugins.

## Exercises

1. **Add a New Feature**: Try adding a new feature to the DB-FX project, like managing another entity (e.g., categories, shelves).
2. **Modify Existing Logic**: Change how certain operations are performed, like altering the search functionality to include more parameters.
3. **Improve the UI**: Design and implement new UI elements using JavaFX Scene Builder.
